# Tasks: Initialize Universo Platformo Rust Project

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-initialize-rust-platformo/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification, therefore NO test tasks are included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from other stories
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from other stories

**Note**: All user stories are designed to be independently implementable and testable

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1**:
- Documentation files before verification
- English documentation before Russian translations
- All content complete before structure verification

**User Story 2**:
- All labels can be created in parallel
- No dependencies between labels

**User Story 3**:
- Documentation files can be created in parallel
- English documentation before Russian translations
- Package template examples independent

**User Story 4**:
- Cargo configuration before CI/CD
- CI/CD before verification steps
- Scripts can be created in parallel
- Verification steps must be last

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: Tasks T003, T004, T005, T006 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: Most tasks within each package can run in parallel (marked with [P])
  - All 5 shared packages (universo-types, universo-utils, universo-api-client, universo-i18n, universo-ui-components) can be developed in parallel by different team members
  - Within each package, module files can be created in parallel
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: 
  - Tasks T042-T051 (English README sections) can run in parallel
  - Tasks T054-T058 (GitHub instructions) can run in parallel
  - Tasks T059-T061 (project configuration) can run in parallel
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: All label creation tasks (T062-T081) can run in parallel
- **Phase 5 (US3)**:
  - Tasks T082-T088 (English documentation) can run in parallel
  - Tasks T090-T094 (package documentation) can run in parallel
  - Tasks T095-T098 (contribution guide) can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 (US4)**:
  - Tasks T102-T108 (workspace dependencies) can run in parallel
  - Tasks T110-T117 (build and dev tools) can run in parallel
  - Tasks T127-T131 (scripts) can run in parallel
- **Phase 7**: Most documentation tasks (T139-T156) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 (Foundational)

If you have a team of 5 developers, the shared infrastructure packages can be built in parallel:

```bash
# Developer A: universo-types package
Task T007-T018: Complete universo-types package

# Developer B: universo-utils package
Task T019-T023: Complete universo-utils package

# Developer C: universo-api-client package
Task T024-T027: Complete universo-api-client package

# Developer D: universo-i18n package
Task T028-T032: Complete universo-i18n package

# Developer E: universo-ui-components package
Task T033-T038: Complete universo-ui-components package

# Then one developer (or automated):
Task T039-T041: Update root workspace and verify build
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Stories (Phase 3-6)

Once Phase 2 is complete, all user stories can proceed in parallel:

```bash
# Developer A: User Story 1 (Repository Setup)
Task T042-T061: Complete all US1 tasks

# Developer B: User Story 2 (Issue Labels)
Task T062-T081: Complete all US2 tasks

# Developer C: User Story 3 (Package Structure)
Task T082-T099: Complete all US3 tasks

# Developer D: User Story 4 (Dev Environment)
Task T100-T138: Complete all US4 tasks
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Critical Path)

**Goal**: Get to a working repository with clear documentation ASAP

1. Complete **Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T006) - ~1 hour
2. Complete **Phase 2: Foundational** (T007-T041) - ~2-3 days
   - This creates all shared infrastructure packages
   - CRITICAL: Nothing else can proceed until this is done
3. Complete **Phase 3: User Story 1** (T042-T061) - ~1 day
   - This creates all essential documentation
   - Makes the repository understandable to new developers
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: 
   - Can a new developer clone and understand the project?
   - Does `cargo build --workspace` succeed?
5. Optional: Complete Phase 4 (US2 - Labels) for better issue tracking

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1, 2, and 3 only (Setup + Foundational + Repository Documentation)

### Incremental Delivery

**Full Feature Set**: All 4 user stories

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): Setup + All shared infrastructure → Foundation complete
2. **+ User Story 1** (Phase 3): Documentation → Repository ready for contributors
3. **+ User Story 2** (Phase 4): Labels → Issue tracking organized
4. **+ User Story 3** (Phase 5): Package templates → New feature development enabled
5. **+ User Story 4** (Phase 6): Dev environment → Full development workflow ready
6. **+ Polish** (Phase 7): Final touches → Production ready

Each addition builds on previous work without breaking existing functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

**Optimal Team Size**: 4-6 developers

**Phase 2 (Foundational)** - Parallel by package:
- Dev 1: universo-types
- Dev 2: universo-utils  
- Dev 3: universo-api-client
- Dev 4: universo-i18n
- Dev 5: universo-ui-components
- Dev 6: Workspace integration (T039-T041)

**Phases 3-6 (User Stories)** - Parallel by story:
- Dev 1: User Story 1 (Repository Setup)
- Dev 2: User Story 2 (Issue Labels)
- Dev 3: User Story 3 (Package Structure)
- Dev 4: User Story 4 (Dev Environment)

**Phase 7 (Polish)** - Parallel by area:
- Dev 1: Health check implementation
- Dev 2: Additional documentation
- Dev 3: Repository metadata
- Dev 4: Quality assurance

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies on incomplete work)
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to user stories for traceability
  - [US1]: Repository Setup and Structure
  - [US2]: Issue Labels and Workflow Foundation
  - [US3]: Package Structure Template
  - [US4]: Development Environment Configuration
- **No tests**: Tests are not explicitly requested in the specification, so no test tasks are included
- **Independent stories**: Each user story can be completed and tested independently
- **Commit frequently**: Commit after each task or logical group of related tasks
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate independently before proceeding to next phase
- **Bilingual requirement**: All documentation must have EN and RU versions with identical structure
